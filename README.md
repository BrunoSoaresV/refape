This project aims to develop a facial recognition system for employee attendance management within companies. Leveraging a variety of technologies, including PHP, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Git, Docker, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, Python, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Azure services, a comprehensive solution has been created.

The project leader oversaw the entire development lifecycle, from planning to execution, ensuring seamless integration of various components. The system utilizes PHP and JavaScript for backend and frontend development, respectively, with PostgreSQL as the database management system. Git is employed for version control, Docker for containerization, and Azure services for cloud computing capabilities.

Additionally, the project implements CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap to design an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Python is used for the implementation of Convolutional Neural Network algorithms for facial recognition.

This project served as the Final Course Project (TCC) in the Technical Course in Informatics at the Federal Institute of Minas Gerais. It received a 100% approval rating, reflecting the successful implementation and effectiveness of the solution in real-world scenarios.
